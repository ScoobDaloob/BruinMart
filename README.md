# Welcome to [BruinMart](https://bruinmart.vercel.app)

BruinMart was built by UCLA students, for UCLA students to simplify buying and selling within our community while keeping it secure and reliable.

As students, we know how difficult it can be to find affordable furniture, textbooks, or everyday essentials, especially with the presence of untrustworthy sellers and inflated prices. Public platforms often feel risky, leaving you guessing about who’s on the other side of a transaction.

That’s why we created BruinMart: a platform exclusively for UCLA students and alumni, where every user is verified, every transaction is protected, and every exchange is designed to give you peace of mind. No scams, no sketchy meetups—just Bruins helping Bruins.
